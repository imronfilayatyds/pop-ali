# About this webpage

Hi, everyone. I made this simple web page design using vanila CSS and JS.  
This web page is now online at: [https://imronfilayatyds.github.io/pop-ali/](https://imronfilayatyds.github.io/pop-ali/)  

I started with the mobile look first since everyone now mostly open websites on their phone.

## The Breakpoints
I used the common breakpoints for responsive web design, which are:  
* Mobile Phone (screen width &le; 480px)
* Tablets (481px &le; screen width &le; 768px)
* Laptop screens (789px &le; screen width &le; 1024px)
* Larger laptop screens or desktops (1025px &le; screen width &le; 1200px)
* Extra large screens (screen width &ge; 1201px)


## Design for Mobile
On mobile screens (<mark>480px or less</mark>), navigation menu will be _hidden inside_ the hamburger menu.  
The following images are the example of how the web page will look on iPhone 12 Pro.  
* Navigation menu items are in the hamburger menu
* The texts and the action button in front of the hero image are center-aligned.
* Variants are displayed vertically in a column format to allow viewers to easily compare and select options.
* Game rules section is displayed in this order: title, image, and description.
* Footer menu items are displayed in a column layout for better visibility.

</div>




## Design for Tablets
For a tablets screen (<mark>bigger than 480px, but not bigger that 768px</mark>), navigation menu items will be displayed in row layout.
The following images are the sample view on tablet Surface Duo (in clampshell mode).  
There are some change on the variants section and footer.

</div>




## Design for Laptop or Small Dekstop Screens
On bigger tablet screens, laptop or small desktop screens (<mark>bigger than 768px, but not bigger that 1024px</mark>), the texts and the action in the hero image will be placed differently.  
Also there's a change of the game rules section, now the image will be place on the right side of the text (I used grid property for this rearrangement).  
Here's how the web page will look on an iPad Air.

## Design for Larger Laptop or Dekstop Screens
For this category and beyond (<mark>bigger than 1024px</mark>), I've made minor adjustments like increasing font size and ensuring optimal webpage display.  
I do hope this will not be weird at all. Here's how the page will look on a Macbook Pro.
